## Description

Positive pay is a banking service that helps businesses prevent check and Automated Clearing House (ACH) fraud by automatically cross-referencing payment requests against a list of pre-authorized transactions. If a discrepancy is found, the bank flags the item and holds the payment until the company decides whether to approve or reject it.
